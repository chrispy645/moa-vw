## Experiments

* The `acc` folder is for reproducing the figures in the tech report that show the accuracy and time plots for SGDMultiClass and VW.
* The `mem` folder is for reproducing the figure that compares the time/memory usage for meta/dense/sparse ARFFs.

These scripts require R to be installed (more specifically, `RScript` should be in the `$PATH` variable), and require `$MOA_HOME` and `$WEKA_HOME` to be set.
